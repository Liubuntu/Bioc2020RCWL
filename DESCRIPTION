Description: This workshop introduces the Bioconductor toolchain for
	     usage and development of reproducible bioinformatics
	     pipelines using packages of Rcwl and RcwlPipelines. The
	     Common Workflow Language (CWL) is an open standard for
	     development of data analysis workflows that is portable
	     and scalable across different tools and working
	     environments. Rcwl provides a simple way to wrap command
	     line tools and build CWL data analysis pipelines
	     programmatically within R. It increases the ease of
	     development, usage, and maintenance of CWL pipelines, and
	     furthermore offers higher performance by intuitively
	     supporting parallel work on high performance computing
	     (HPC). hundreds of pre-built bioinformatics pipelines in
	     CWL are included in RcwlPipelines. The tools and
	     pipelines are highly modularized for easy customization
	     of complex bioinformatics analysis. An scRNA-seq pipeline
	     using STARsolo for alignment and quantification,
	     DropletUtils for filtering raw gene-barcode matrix will
	     demonstrate the typical use case of these two
	     packages. More details for usage and examples are
	     available on Rcwl
